* Transaction Strategy

All mutating SQL DML queries (UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE) shall be contained inside a
transaction, which is done at the model layer. A single HTTP request shall not
cause more than one transaction to be executed. This also means that each HTTP
request shall not cause more than one model layer action.

** Transaction Length

Transactions should be as short as possible, but also include all prerequisite
fetches.

For example, the UserManager.login action's transaction includes fetching the
User row, verifying the password hash, and creating the UserSession row.
However, any "shape" validation (such as requiring a minimum password length
or complexity) shall be done before the transaction is initiated.
