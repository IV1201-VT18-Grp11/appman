* Roles

We're using a hierarchical role strategy, with the following fixed roles:

- [[Anonymous]]
- [[Applicant][Applicant]] (default for new accounts)
- [[Employee][Employee]]
- [[Admin][Admin]]

Each role has access to everything the previous roles can do.

** Anonymous

   This is a "pseudorole" that is applied whenever the user is not logged in.
   They are allowed to view all job listings.

** Applicant

   This is the default role when a new user account is created. They have all
   rights of anonymous users. They are allowed to apply to a listing, and to
   view their own applications.

** Employee

   Employees have all rights that applicants have. Additionally, they may view
   any job application (not just their own), as well as create, modify, and
   delete job listings.

** Admin

   Admins have all rights that employees have. Additionally, they may delete
   users and job applications, as well as adjust the roles of other users.
