* Roles

We're using a hierarchical role strategy, with the following fixed roles:

- [[Applicant][Applicant]] (the default)
- [[Employee][Employee]]
- [[Admin][Admin]]

Each role has access to everything the previous roles can do.

** Applicant

   This is the default role. They are allowed to view all job listings, apply to
   a listing, and to view their own applications.

** Employee

   Employees have all rights that applicants have. Additionally, they may view
   any job application (not just their own), as well as create, modify, and
   delete job listings.

** Admin

   Admins have all rights that employees have. Additionally, they may delete
   users and job applications, as well as adjust the roles of other users.
