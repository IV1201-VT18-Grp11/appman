* Logging Strategy

There are three different kinds of items that shall be logged:

- Authentication actions
- Diagnostics
- Errors

Authentication actions shall be logged so that users who repeatedly try (and)
fail can be found out and rate-limited.

Major tasks that can cause problems shall be logged so that it's easy diagnose
what's going wrong if the system crashes or hangs. For example, the initializing
the password hasher can take a very long time if there is insufficient entropy
in the system pool.

Finally, errors should be logged so that the developers can fix them.

** Location

During development logs shall go to standard output, so that it's accessible
to the developers. In production logs shall be located in the systemd unit
journal.
